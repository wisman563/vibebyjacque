[Verse 1]
Today’s the day
The world turns just for you
Wisman
Your light shines in every hue
Like a comet blazing
Cutting through the sky
You’re the reason the sun feels warm and high

[Chorus]
Happy Birthday
Wisman
With a sweet melody
Sending love and good vibes across the sea
May your dreams take flight
May your heart feel free
Happy Birthday
Wisman
You’re the song in our key

[Verse 2]
The candles flicker
But they’ll never outshine
The glow you bring
A spark so divine
Every moment whispers
“This day is yours”
A celebration echoes through all the shores

[Prechorus]
Blow out the candles
Make a wish tonight
The universe listens
It’ll hold you tight

[Chorus]
Happy Birthday
Wisman
With a sweet melody
Sending love and good vibes across the sea
May your dreams take flight
May your heart feel free
Happy Birthday
Wisman
You’re the song in our key

[Bridge]
The clock may tick
But it’s your parade
Every beat of the drum
Every note we played
This life’s your canvas
Paint it wild and grand
We’re here to cheer
We’re your biggest band
